In my daily work, I take many screenshots: bug reproductions, snippets of code, UI examples, receipts, and reference diagrams. They quickly clutter my Desktop and are hard to find later because they have generic names like “Screenshot 2025-09-25 at 10.12.43 AM.png.” The context behind each image—why I captured it, what action it implies, and which project it belongs to—is lost. This manual triage costs time and leads to missed follow-ups. The AI Screenshot Triage Agent solves this by automatically watching for new screenshots, extracting a concise summary, tasks, and tags via a vision model, renaming/moving the file into a project-friendly structure, and generating a linked markdown note so I can act on it later.
